Caffeine for Wireless Xbox One Controller

[Download](https://github.com/rishubil/CaffeineXC/releases/latest)

## 1. What is it?

The wireless Xbox One Controller connected to the PC will be automatically turned off if left unused for a few minutes.
However, CaffeineXC keeps the wireless Xbox One Controller powered on.

I connect a microphone to the Xbox One Controller and use it as a wireless microphone device. 
Obviously, there was a problem that the Xbox One controller continued to turn off while using the Xbox One Controller as an audio input device.
I developed this to solve this problem.

## 2. How can I use it?

Connect any devices to the audio jack of your Xbox One Controller and connect the controller to your PC. Then, run CaffeineXC.
The Xbox One Controller will not turn off automatically while CaffeineXC is running.

## 3. How it works?

If the Xbox One Controller is playing audio, it will not automatically turn off.
CaffeineXC just activates the audio output of the Xbox One Controller and plays NOTHING.
In other words, it plays audio with a volume of zero.
